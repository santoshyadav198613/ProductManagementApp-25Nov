Services:
1. Resusable code
2. We achieve loosely coupled system.
3. Seperates business logic.
4. Interact with API.

How:
1. ng g service <service_name>
2. Registering a service in AppModule will make it accessble to entire app.
3.It also makes it Singleton
4. In case we don't want service to be accssible by other components, register in component itlsef.
5. In case we don't want to use Singleton instance, we can override by registering with component.


DI:
It is most widely used design pattern.
never create an instance of class directly into your own class.
Always inject your class in constructor.    


Singleton:
One instance of a class will be available.

Types of services:

Class based service:

Non-Class based service:
1. Value Provider -- we can use constants as a service.
3. Factory -- To be discussed during routing
