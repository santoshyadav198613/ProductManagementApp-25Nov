What:

It will provide navigation to different parts on app.
Also we can pass data in url, we can read the same.
we can restrict the access to urls.
we can also use routing to pre-load the data.*
we can achieve SPA.

How:
1. import RouterModule and register the same.
2. <router-outlet></router-outlet> -- the components gets loaded after this tag.


Angular Modules:

ng g module <module_name>

1. Routing Module : We will add all routing config into this module.
2. Feature Module: Clubbing all things related to a Feature together.
3. Shared Module:  we can add all common modules like forms, http or any third party module here

Guards: Guards will be used to restrict the access to URLs
ng g guard <guard_name>

canActivate:
canActivateChild:
canDeActivate:

Dynamic Routes:

we can create url like 'todo/:id' where id is the key.
to read the values use ActivatedRoute service

Lazy Loading:
should be implemented for least used module.

steps:
1. feature module should not be part of any other module.
2. Nothing shouls be shared like component/service.
3. add routing in routing module and add loadChildren property.
