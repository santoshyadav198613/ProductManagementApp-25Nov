How to create a component:
1. ng g c <component_name>

Binding:
1. interpolation: we can use {{<var>}} to display our data.
2. Property Binding: we use [] "box" syntax.
3. Event Binding: use () "banana" syntax for event binding.

Built-in Directices:
1. *ngIf :  this is a structured directive which removes the element from DOM.
2. *ngFor: To bind the array object we can use ngFor.
3. ngSwitch: Similar to switch case
4. ngClass: To provide the classes at runtime based on some action.
